# Named Queries

* Extract and refactor to new service
* Projections: IIIF 2, 3; PDF
* Pass in link to IIIF Manifest that _uses_ the Image API endpoints; PDF projection reads the text content of canvases and includes it in the PDF (Fireball enhancement) => proper text in PDF
* Research need for other projections like ePUB

Note that there is a class of named queries that doesn't require that the DLCS hosts the images, but that might not be a named query any more.
