# Upgrade IIIF versions

* Named queries can project Presentation 3
* Proper AV support in projections
* Image API 3
* Auth 0.9.3 => 1

Our work on /thumbs/ has started a new version of https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-model

We will extend this to make a nice IIIF Library for .NET Core.

This can succeed the existing iiif-model library. It will natively use Presentation 3 for fluent building of IIIF, even more pleasantly than the current one.

It will also include a converter that produces IIIF 2.1 from this model, rather than offer extensive support for both models.
