# IIIF Library for .NET Core

* Will become a successor to https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-model
* Will natively use Presentation 3 for fluent building...
* And supply a converter that produces IIIF 2.1 from this model.

Start developing the library as part of the dlcs/protagonist solution, then later move to its own repo, and nuget.
